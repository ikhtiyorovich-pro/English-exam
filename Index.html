            Travel expands a person's worldview and gives pleasure to life. I do
            not deny it and I travel often every year. Unfortunately, I haven't
            been able to travel as much as I would have liked this year. The
            reason for this was that I went to other extra classes outside of
            school.

            Last month, I went to Turkey with my family. We stayed in Ankara,
            near Istanbul. We stayed 2 days in there. I will tell you about it
            now. We went there by plane. We paid $700 per person. The worst this
            was the cheapest ticket price. We went there as a group of 6 and
            paid $4,200. But we paid for our hotel, travel and meals separately.

            First day, we visited museums, historical monuments, mausoleums. The
            Museum of Anatolian Civilizations is one of the most impressive
            museums I've seen. This museum is reason enough to include Ankara on
            your Turkey itinerary. Because, It's the only place in the country
            where you can grasp the full scope of Anatolia's pre-Classical-era
            human history.

            Then we went to Atatürk's mausoleum. Ankara's most visited
            attraction is Turkey's most important modern shrine. At the top of
            the hill on the western side of the city center is the mausoleum of
            Atatürk (Mustafa Kemal), the founder of the Turkish state. large
            area, includes a large museum. Then we left there and went to the
            hotel.

            My friends who went to Turkey praised Turkish food very much. Ankara
            has more cafes and restaurants than any other city. Therefore, on
            the second day, we went to one of Ankara's most famous restaurants,
            Duveroğlu, and ate delicious food there. I usually eat kebab more
            than any other food. That's why I ate kebab there. My family ordered
            another meal.The next day we had to return to Tashkent, so we left the restaurant and went to the hotel.
